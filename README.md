# ArgumentDestroyer
Delectron desktop application that turns images and GIFs into speech bubble memes. You can upload just one or many at a time.
### How to use:
Upload your images/GIFs and wait until the app becomes responsive. If you can't move the window around or it has a loading cursor, that means it is currently processing your files. Be patient as this can take a while with large GIFs or if you upload in batch. Once it is responsive again, there will be a new folder created in the app directory called "ArgumentDestroyers" with your finished files.
